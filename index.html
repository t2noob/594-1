<li>Prerequisite: Good programming skills</li>
<li>Textbook: Instructor Web pages and other readings available for free on the Web </li>
<li>Instructor: David Turner</li>
<li>Office Hours: Mon. &amp; Tue. 2:00 - 4:00</li>

</ul><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We meet twice per week.  In addition to the weekly meetings, you can communicate with the class as a whole by posting to the CSUSB CSE 594 Winter 2013 Google Group.</p>

<p>The course is centered around building simple 2D games build with Web technologies and that run in both desktop and mobile environments.  Students will maintain their code in a GitHub repository and publish their Web applications using Google App Engine.  </p>

<p>The main language used in this course will be Javascript.  The course will also rely on a small amount of Java running on the server side.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>You can do all required work in this course using any of the three common operating systems: Windows, OS X and Linux.  All required software can be downloaded and installed for free.  You can also use the computers in JB 358 and JB 359 to do all required work in this course. The open times for accessing these labs is available from the CSE website or by contacting the CSE main office.</p>

<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Establish a Google account if you donâ€™t already have one.  (Your CSUSB email account is not sufficient.) The purpose of this account is to publish your applications through Google App Engine. </li>
<li>Send me your preferred email. I will use this to register you with the CSUSB CSE 594 Winter 2013 Google Group.</li>
<li>Establish a GitHub account if you don't already have one.  You will maintain your source code in this repository.</li>
</ul><h2>Course Goals</h2>

<p>The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of mobile application development that relies on Web technologies. Sub-topics of this course include cloud computing, system integration, Javascript, Java, system architecture, version control, security, distributed key-value data stores.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to develop mobile applications with Web technologies.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop complex systems using Javascript.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop and deploy scalable applications that use cloud-based application hosting, key-value data stores, third-party authentication and user cloud storage.</li>
<li>Learn how to use the Eclipse IDE to build and deploy Java Web applications to Google App Engine.</li>
<li>Learn how to use Git to manage source code.</li>
<li>Learn how to build mobile and web applications using HTML5.</li>
</ul><h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>In this course, you will primarily focus on research and experimentation resulting in a collection of small prototypes.  You should strive to make your code as readable as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is source code well-organized? Have unnecessary variables and logic been removed from the code?  Does the indentation and line spacing show logical structure?  Is indentation and spacing done consistently?  Are concerns separated when possible?  Are the responsibilities of components clear and consistently assigned?  Does the code contain names for variables, functions and classes that unambiguously express their purpose in the program?  Are comments included when needed? Are superfluous comments omitted?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Program readability is important because real-world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new functionality.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>I will base your grade on the following criteria.</p>

<pre><code>Grade   Criteria
-----   ---------------------------------------------------------------
  A     Consistent research and experimentation in each week through
        out the quarter.
  B     Provides evidence of reading and experimentation on topics 
        covered by the class.
  C     Provides evidence of reading on topics covered by the course
        but with inadequate experimentation.
  D     Shows up to class but does not provide evidence of any effort
        beyond this.
  F     Absent from class and no evidence of reading and experimentation.
</code></pre>

<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you are in need of an accommodation for a disability in order to participate in this class, please let me know as soon as possible, and also contact Services to Students with Disabilities at UH-183, (909) 537-5238.  You are advised to establish a buddy system and alternate in the class if you require assistance in the event of an emergency. Individuals with disabilities should prepare for an emergency ahead of time by instructing a classmate and the instructor.
Academic Regulations and Procedures</p>

<p>See the CSUSB Bulletin of Courses for the University's policies on course withdrawal, cheating, and plagiarism.</p>

<h2>Computer Science and Engineering Club</h2>

<p>The Computer Science and Engineering Club is a student-run organization that uses a combination of email and campus meetings to plan events, ask and answer technical questions, post job and internship openings, and discuss other topics of interest to computing majors at CSUSB. Club-sponsored events include seminars, workshops, tutoring and fun activities.</p>
